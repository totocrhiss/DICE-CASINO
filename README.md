Creation of the gif file for the jackpot animation.

The jackpot and animation were created with the BLENDER software.

Export to PNG image from BLENDER.

I create it in gif with the software ScreenToGif exported to webp.

I start to position the elements in CSS with DOM manipulation in javascript.

I create a function to recover the number in PNG file for the end of the gif animation.
