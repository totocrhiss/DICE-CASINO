The game is called DICE-CASINO.

- I programmed in HTML-CSS-JAVASCRIPT with the THREE.JS library to create the dice and Board scene.

- I added the GSAP - GreenSock library for the dice animation effects.

- I created a Class (StyleCss) with a "constructor()" in Javascript for all other animations programming in pure Javascript.

- I created a Class (Sound) with a "constructor()" in Javascript to program the different sound effects in a time defines separate.

- I created the Die and the board of the game in three dimensions with the BLENDER software, I export it in GLTF and GLB, then I load it with THREE.  JS and I create the scene in the HTML canvas.

- THREE. JS animation works with WebGL Working Group.

- API-like cross-platform web environment.

- The PNG background and casino roulette, I created them with the Inkscape vector software that I exported to SVG, then animated them with Javascript.

- I modeled the jackpot object and animate with the BLENDER software, then exported the animation to PNG with 60 frames per second.

- I imported the images with the ScreenToGif software and finished the editing by reducing the PNG to 33 Frames per second and exporting to GIF to integrate into HTML and animate it with Javascript programming.

- I used CSS Media Queries for mobile-first and supplemented with Javascript matchMedia() to adapt the focus animations according to the size of a mobile screen.

- I created everything from templates and images to GIF and programming for a first program and evaluation for STUDI.

-I put my program online.
